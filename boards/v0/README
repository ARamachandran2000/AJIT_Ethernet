System Details :
	- Processor_1x1x32 : 75MHz
	- RAM		   : 4MB, 75MHz
	- NIC		   : 156.25MHz
	- MAC_engine	   : 156.25MHz
	- DualClocked fifos: 4
	- clk_wiz	   : 2(156.25 and 75 MHz)	
	- ACB_tap	   : tap addr Max = 0xFF000000, Min = 0xFFFEFFFF
	- ACB_Mux	   : 
	- ACB_AFB converter: for NIC slave interface.

Testing Mechanism :
	1. Processor Provies all queue pointers to nic and starts it.
		nic writes NIC_REG[22]=1 when it starts.
	2. A mac engine is written which will send packet to nic.
	3. Nic does its work of sending packet to memory and 
		reading it back after processing is done.
	4. Nic transmits packet out and mofifies NIC_REG[21]
			(which will keep count of packets trensmitted).
