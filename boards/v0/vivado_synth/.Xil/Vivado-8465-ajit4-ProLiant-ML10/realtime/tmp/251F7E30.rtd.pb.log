INFO: [Synth 8-4480] The timing for the instance i_4/nic_instance/MemorySpace_memory_space_0/nonTrivGen.core/mb/memBase/ColGen[0].RowGen[0].baseMem/mem_array_reg (implemented as a block RAM) might be sub-optimal as no optional output register could be merged into the block ram. Providing additional output register may help in improving timing.
