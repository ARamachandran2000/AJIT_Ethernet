The testbench written in C:

	will model the MAC (generate a stream of bytes for a "standard" packet".
	will model the external memory (connected directly to NIC).
	will model the processor (programs the nic using the peripheral bus).
	will model the "algorithm"
		- initialize the queues 
		- pop from nic->server queues.
		- push into server->nic queues.


You may need a tester.aa
	to interface the "HW" with the testbench.
