The testbench written in C:

	will model the MAC (generate a stream of bytes for a "standard" packet".
	will model the external memory (connected directly to NIC).
	will model the processor (programs the nic using the peripheral bus).
	will model the "algorithm"
		- initialize the queues 
		- pop from nic->server queues.
		- push into server->nic queues.

Folder contains :
	header.h :
        	all declerations.

	InterfaceDataStructures_Utils.h:
        	queues related functions.

	MAC.c :
	        MAC tx and rx threads

	Memory_8.c :
	        Memory thread.

	Processor.c :
	        Processor thread.

	register_config.c :
        	functionality to configure NIC.

	testbench.c :
	        Main testbench file.

	test_compile.sh:
	        To compile testbench.

	tester.aa :
	        contains modules which merge/split pipes.
