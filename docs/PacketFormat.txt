		[31:0]   start address

	c. For a write request packet, there will be
	   number-of-words additional 64-bit words to be
	   written into startaddr + 0, + stride, + 2*stride etc..

2.  Response packet:
	
	a.  For write response packet.

		[63:61] tag
		[23:16] error code (0 if no error).
		[11:0]  number of words in response (in this case 0)
