	AJIT system core memory interface protocol

1.  Request packet:
	A 110-bit format.
	
	Request[109:0]
		Request[109]  = lock-bit
		Request[108]  = read/write-bar 
		Request[107:100] = byte mask
			write data is organized as 8-bytes. if bit 7 (MSb) of byte-mask
			is set, the top byte of write data is written, else not.
		Request[99:64] = address (36-bit)
		Request[63:0]  = write-data.

	
2.  Response packet:
	A 65-bit format.

		Response[64] = Error
		Response[63:0] = read-data


3. For every request packet, there is a response.
